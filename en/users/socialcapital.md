# How to increase your capital

The greater the social capital of your account, the more or more often you can reward people who benefit you. Therefore, the main task of any VIZ participant is to increase their social capital. This can be done in two ways: by bringing benefit and pleasure to other people or by buying viz tokens.

## Benefit or pleasure

When you bring benefit or pleasure to other people, they thank you: they say «Thank you!», like, retweet, or even send a donation. VIZ simplifies and makes it universal to award people for any occasion and in any situation. Every gratitude from other people turns into a small increase in your social capital in the VIZ. Over time, your account will accumulate a lot of thanks, which means that your social capital will grow significantly.

The easiest way is to get rewards for online activity. If a social network, mobile app, game or messenger is connected to the VIZ (which is done quite easily), all participants can exchange awards.

# How to increase capital

The greater the social capital of your account, the more or more often you can reward people who benefit you. Therefore, the main task of any VISA participant is to increase their social capital. This can be done in two ways: by bringing benefit and pleasure to other people or by buying viz tokens.

## Benefit or pleasure

When you bring benefit or pleasure to other people, they thank you: they say "Thank you!", like, retweet, or even send a donation. VISA simplifies and makes it universal to award people for any occasion and in any situation. Every gratitude from other people turns into a small increase in your social capital in the visa. Over time, your account will accumulate a lot of thanks, which means that your social capital will grow significantly.

The easiest way is to get rewards for online activity. If a social network, mobile app, game or messenger is connected to the VIZ (which is done quite easily), all participants can exchange awards.

For example, when communicating in Telegram chats, where the administrator has connected the [VIZ social bot](https://t.me/viz_social_bot), it is enough to start responding to someone's message with a «+» or a «thumbs up» emoji, and the author of this message will receive a reward from you. And vice versa: if someone «gave a thumbs-up» in response to your message, you will receive a reward to your VIZ account.

The ecosystem of awards in VIZ is growing: you can award and receive awards in Telegram, Twitter, YouTube, Golos.id and on other sites.

Another way to receive awards and reward is to do it directly through [Personal Account](https://my.viz.plus) or other applications that work with the VIZ blockchain. In this case, you \(or a person grateful to you) simply specify the account of the recipient of the award and choose its size at will (within the capabilities of your social capital).

Of course, everyone understands the words «benefit» and «pleasure» in their own way. VIZ is neutral: it is possible to increase social capital not only by socially recognized «good deeds», but also by any activity that one or another people like. Everyone decides for himself who to reward and for what, and what to do to receive awards. There are no censors or «administration» in the VIZ, but there is complete freedom of action and opinion, which is technically impossible to limit.

## Purchasing of viz tokens

You can also increase your social capital faster: just buy as many viz as you want and transfer them to social capital. This method is suitable, for example, for not very socially active people, as well as those who want to reward large amounts right away, or businesses to encourage their customers.

The addresses of online stores, exchanges and exchangers where you can buy vizs, you will find on the sites dedicated to VIZ and VIZ Ecosystem.
